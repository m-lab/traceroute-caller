.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides the ability to execute Internet measurement techniques
to IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, in parallel, to fill a specified
packets-per-second rate.  Currently,
.Nm
supports the well-known traceroute and ping techniques,
as well as MDA traceroute, alias resolution, some parts of tbit, sting,
and neighbour discovery.
.Pp
.Nm
has five modes of operation.
First,
.Nm
can be supplied a list of addresses on the command line with the
.Fl i
option.
.Nm
will then execute a command with each of the supplied addresses, in parallel,
and output the results as each task completes.
Second,
.Nm
can be supplied a list of addresses in a listfile, one address per line,
using the
.Fl f
option.
Third,
.Nm
can be supplied a list of complete commands on the command line with the
.Fl I
option.
Fourth,
.Nm
can be instructed to listen on an IP address and port specified with the
.Fl P
option, or on a unix domain socket specified with the
.Fl U
option, where it can take commands dynamically.
Finally,
.Nm
can be instructed to connect to a remote host and port specified with the
.Fl R
option, where it will be supplied with commands dynamically.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl ?
prints a list of command line options and a synopsis of each.
.It Fl v
causes
.Nm
to output version information and exit.
.It Fl D
With this option set,
.Nm
will detach and become a daemon.  Use with the
.Fl P
or
.Fl U
options.
.It Fl c Ar command
specifies the command for
.Nm
to use by default. The current choices for this option are:
.Bl -dash -offset 2n -compact -width 1n
.It
.Sy dealias
.It
.Sy neighbourdisc
.It
.Sy ping
.It
.Sy trace
.It
.Sy tracelb
.It
.Sy sniff
.It
.Sy sting
.It
.Sy tbit
.El
.Nm
uses trace by default.
The available commands and their options are documented below.
.It Fl p Ar pps
specifies the target packets-per-second rate for
.Nm
to reach.  By default, this value is 20.
.It Fl w Ar window
specifies the maximum number of tasks that may be probed in parallel.
A value of zero places no upper limit.
By default, zero is used.
.It Fl M Ar monitorname
specifies the canonical name of machine where
.Nm
is run.
This value is used when recording the output in a warts output file.
.It Fl l Ar listname
specifies the name of the list when run from the command line.
This value is used when recording the output in a warts output file.
.It Fl L Ar listid
specifies the numerical id of the list when run from the command line.
This value is used when recording the output in a warts output file.
.It Fl C Ar cycleid
specifies the numerical cycle id to begin with when run from the command line.
This value is used when recording the output in a warts output file.
.It Fl o Ar outfile
specifies the default output file to write measurement results to.  By
default, stdout is used.
.It Fl F Ar firewall
specifies that
.Nm
may use the firewall in measurements that require it
(tbit and sting).
.Nm
supports two firewall types: IPFW, and PF.
To use the IPFW firewall, pass ipfw:<start>-<end>, where <start> is
the first rule
.Nm
can use, and <end> is the last.
To use the PF firewall, pass pf:<anchor>:<num>, where <anchor> is the
anchor for
.Nm
to use, and <num> specifies the number of rules
.Nm
is allowed to use.
.It Fl d Ar debugfile
specifies a filename to write debugging messages to.  By default, no
debugfile is used, though debugging output is sent to stderr if scamper is
built for debugging.
.It Fl e Ar pidfile
specifies a file to write scamper's process ID to.
If scamper is built with privilege separation, the ID of the unprivileged
process is written.
.It Fl O Ar options
allows scamper's behaviour to be further tailored.
The current choices for this option are:
.Bl -dash -offset 2n -compact -width 1n
.It
.Sy text:
output results in plain text.  Suitable for interactive use.
.It
.Sy warts:
output results in warts format.  Suitable for archiving measurement
results and for use by researchers as it records details that cannot be
easily represented with the text option.
.It
.Sy json:
output results in json format.  Suitable for processing measurement
results with a scripting language.  A better approach is to output
results in warts format, and to use
.Xr sc_warts2json 1 .

.Sy planetlab:
tell scamper it is running on a planetlab system.  Necessary to use
planetlab's safe raw sockets.
.It
.Sy rawtcp:
tell scamper to use IPPROTO_RAW socket to send IPv4 TCP probes, rather than
a datalink socket.
.It
.Sy select:
tell scamper to use
.Xr select 2
rather than
.Xr poll 2
.It
.Sy kqueue:
tell scamper to use
.Xr kqueue 2
rather than
.Xr poll 2
on systems where
.Xr kqueue 2
is available.
.It
.Sy epoll:
tell scamper to use
.Xr epoll 7
rather than
.Xr poll 2
on systems where
.Xr epoll 7
is available.
.It
.Sy tsps:
the input file consists of a sequence of IP addresses for pre-specified
IP timestamps.
.It
.Sy cmdfile:
the input file consists of complete commands.

.It
.Sy outcopy:
write a copy of all data written by scamper with the default output method.
.It
.Sy debugfileappend:
append to the debugfile specified with the
.Fl d
option.  The default is to truncate the debugfile.
.It
.Sy tls:
require the use of TLS with the remove controller specified with the
.Fl R
option.
.It
.Sy notls:
do not use TLS anywhere in scamper, including tbit.
.El
.It Fl i Ar IP 1..N
specifies the addresses to probe, on the command line, using the command
specified with the
.Fl c
option.
.It Fl f Ar listfile
specifies the input file to read for target addresses, one per line, and
uses the command specified with the
.Fl c
option on each.
.It Fl I Ar cmds.
specifies complete commands, including target addresses, for scamper to
execute.
.It Fl P Ar [ip:]port
specifies that
.Nm
provide a control socket listening on the specified IP address and port on
the local host.  If an IP address is not specified,
.Nm
will bind to the port specified on the loopback address.
.It Fl R Ar name:port
specifies that
.Nm
connects to a specified remote host and port to receive commands.
.It Fl U Ar unix domain socket
specifies that
.Nm
provide a control socket listening on the specified socket in the unix

.Sh TRACE OPTIONS
The trace command is used for conducting traceroute.
The following variations of the
.Xr traceroute 8
options are available:
.Pp
trace
.Bk -words
.Op Fl MQT
.Op Fl c Ar confidence
.Op Fl d Ar dport
.Op Fl f Ar firsthop
.Op Fl g Ar gaplimit
.Op Fl G Ar gapaction
.Op Fl l Ar loops
.Op Fl m Ar maxttl
.Op Fl o Ar offset
.Op Fl O Ar option
.Op Fl p Ar payload
.Op Fl P Ar method
.Op Fl q Ar attempts
.Op Fl r Ar rtr-addr

.Op Fl S Ar srcaddr
.Op Fl t Ar tos
.Op Fl U Ar userid
.Op Fl w Ar wait
.Op Fl W Ar wait-probe
.Op Fl z Ar gss-entry
.Op Fl Z Ar lss-name
.Ek
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar confidence
specifies that a hop should be probed to a specified confidence level
(95% or 99%) to be sure the trace has seen all interfaces that will reply
for that hop.
.It Fl d Ar dport
specifies the base destination port value to use for UDP-based and TCP-based
traceroute methods.  For ICMP-paris, this option sets the ICMP checksum
value.
.It Fl f Ar firsthop
specifies the TTL or HLIM value to begin probing with.  By default,
a first hop of one is used.
.It Fl g Ar gaplimit
specifies the number of unresponsive hops permitted until a check is made to
see if the destination will respond.  By default, a gap limit of 5 hops is
used.  Setting the gap limit to 0 disables the gap limit, but doing this is
not recommended.
.It Fl G Ar gapaction
specifies what should happen if the gaplimit condition is met.  A value of
1 (default) means halt probing, while a value of 2 means send last-ditch
probes.
.It Fl m Ar maxttl
specifies the maximum TTL or HLIM value that will be probed.  By default,
there is no restriction, apart from the 255 hops that the Internet protocols
allow.
.It Fl M
specifies that path MTU discovery (PMTUD) should be attempted for the path
when the initial traceroute completes.
.Nm
will not conduct PMTUD unless it is probing a responsive destination, as
otherwise there is no way to distinguish all packets being lost from just
big packets (larger than MTU) being lost.
.It Fl l Ar loops
specifies the maximum number of loops permitted until probing stops.  By
default, a value of one is used.  A value of zero disables loop checking.
.It Fl o Ar offset
specifies the fragmentation offset to use in probes.  By default, no
offset is used.
.It Fl O Ar option
specifies optional arguments to use.
The current choices for this option are:
.Bl -dash -offset 2n -compact -width 1n
.It
.Sy dl
specifies that the datalink socket should be used to timestamp packets,
and to receive certain packets.
.It
.Sy dtree-noback
specifies that the traceroute should not do backwards probing when using
doubletree.
.El
.It Fl p Ar payload
specifies the payload of the probe to use as a base.
The payload is specified in hexadecimal.
Note that the payload supplied is merely a base; the first 2 bytes may be
modified to accomplish ICMP-Paris and UDP-Paris traceroute.
.It Fl P Ar method
specifies the traceroute method to use.
.Nm
currently supports five different probe methods: UDP, ICMP, UDP-paris,
ICMP-paris, TCP, and TCP-ACK.  By default, UDP-paris is used.
.It Fl q Ar attempts
specifies the maximum number of attempts to obtain a response per hop.  By
default, a value of two is used.
.It Fl Q
specifies that all allocated probes are sent, regardless of how many responses
have been received.
.It Fl r Ar rtr-addr
specifies the IP address of the router to use.
.It Fl s Ar sport
specifies the source port value to use.  For ICMP-based methods, this option
specifies the ICMP identifier to use.
.It Fl S Ar srcaddr
specifies the source address to use in probes.
The address cannot be spoofed.
.It Fl t Ar tos
specifies the value to set in the IP ToS/DSCP + ECN byte.  By default, this
byte is set to zero.
.It Fl T
specifies that time exceeded messages from the destination do not cause the
trace to be defined as reaching the destination.
.It Fl U Ar userid
specifies an unsigned integer to include with the data collected; the meaning
of the user-id is entirely up to the user and has no effect on the behaviour
of traceroute.
.It Fl w Ar wait
specifies how long to wait, in seconds, for a reply.  By default, a value
of 5 is used.
.It Fl W Ar wait-probe
specifies the minimum time to wait, in 10s of milliseconds, between sending
consecutive probes.  By default the next probe is sent as soon as possible.
.It Fl z Ar gss-entry
specifies an IP address to halt probing when encountered; used with the
double-tree algorithm.
.It Fl Z Ar lss-name
specifies the name of the local stop set to use when determining when to
halt probing backwards; used with the double-tree algorithm.
.El
.\""""""""""""
.Sh PING OPTIONS
The ping command is used for conducting ping.
The following variations of the
.Xr ping 8
options are available:
.Pp
ping
.Bk -words
.Op Fl R
.Op Fl A Ar tcp-ack
.Op Fl B Ar payload
.Op Fl c Ar probecount

specifies the ICMP checksum to use when sending a probe.
The payload of each probe will be manipulated so that the checksum is valid.
.It Fl d Ar dport
specifies the destination port to use in each TCP/UDP probe, and the first
ICMP sequence number to use in ICMP probes.
.It Fl F Ar sport
specifies the source port to use in each TCP/UDP probe, and the ICMP ID to
use in ICMP probes.
.It Fl i Ar wait
specifies the length of time to wait, in seconds, between probes.  By default,
a value of 1 is used.
.It Fl m Ar ttl
specifies the TTL value to use for outgoing packets.  By default, a value of
64 is used.
.It Fl M Ar MTU
specifies a pseudo MTU value.  If the response packet is larger than the
pseudo MTU, an ICMP packet too big (PTB) message is sent.
.It Fl o Ar replycount
specifies the number of replies required at which time probing may cease.  By
default, all probes are sent.
.It Fl O Ar options
The current choices for this option are:
.Bl -dash -offset 2n -compact -width 1n
.It
.Sy dl
specifies that the ping should use datalink sockets, rather than raw sockets.
.It
.Sy nosrc
specifies that the real address of the host should not be embedded in
the payload of the packet when the spoof option is used.
.It
.Sy spoof
specifies that the source address is to be spoofed according to the address
specified with the
.Fl S
option.  The address scamper would otherwise use as the source address is
embedded in the payload of the probe unless the nosrc option is used.
.It
.Sy tbt
specifies that the goal of the ping is to obtain fragmented responses, so that
the
.Fl c
option specifies how many packets to send, and the
.Fl o
option specifies how many fragmented responses are desired.
.El
.It Fl p Ar pattern
specifies the pattern, in hex, to use in probes.  Up to 16 bytes may be
specified.  By default, each probe's bytes are zeroed.
.It Fl P Ar method
specifies the type of ping packets to send.
By default, ICMP echo requests are sent.
Choices are: icmp-echo, icmp-time, tcp-syn, tcp-ack, tcp-ack-sport,
tcp-synack, tcp-rst, udp, and udp-dport.
.It Fl R
specifies that the record route IP option should be used.
.It Fl s Ar size
specifies the size of the probes to send.
The probe size includes the length of the IP and ICMP headers.
By default, a probe size of 84 bytes is used for IPv4 pings, and 56 bytes for
IPv6 pings.
.It Fl S Ar srcaddr
specifies the source address to use in probes.
The address can be spoofed if -O spoof is included.
.It Fl T Ar timestamp
specifies that an IP timestamp option be included.
The timestamp option can either be: tsprespec where IP addresses of devices
of interest can be specified; tsonly, where timestamps are embedded by
devices but no IP addresses are included; and tsandaddr, where timestamps
and IP addresses are included by devices in the path.
See the examples section for more information.
.It Fl U Ar userid
specifies an unsigned integer to include with the data collected; the meaning
of the user-id is entirely up to the user and has no effect on the behaviour
of ping.
.It Fl W Ar timeout
specifies how long to wait for responses after the last ping is sent.  By
default this is one second.
.It Fl z Ar tos
specifies the value to use in the IPv4 ToS/DSCP + ECN byte.  By default, this
byte is set to zero.
.El
.\""""""""""""
.Sh DEALIAS OPTIONS
The dealias command is used to send probes for the purpose of alias resolution.
It supports the mercator technique, where aliases are inferred if a router
uses a different address when sending an ICMP response; the ally technique,
where aliases are inferred if a sequence of probes sent to alternating
IP addresses yields responses with incrementing, interleaved IP-ID values;
radargun, where probes are sent to a set of IP addresses in multiple rounds
and aliases are inferred by post-processing the results; prefixscan, where
an alias is searched in a prefix for a specified IP address; and bump,
where two addresses believed to be aliases are probed in an effort to force
their IP-ID values out of sequence.
The following options are available for the
.Nm
dealias command:
.Pp

.It Fl s Ar sport
specifies to the source port to use when sending probes.
Default is based on the process ID.
.El
.\""""""""""""
.Sh SNIFF OPTIONS
The sniff command is used to capture packets matching a specific
signature.  At present, the only supported signature is ICMP echo
packets with a specific ID value, or packets containing such a
quote.
The following options are available for the
.Nm
sniff command:
.Pp
sting
.Bk -words
.Op Fl c Ar limit-pktc
.Op Fl G Ar limit-time

.It Fl S Ar ipaddr
specifies the IP address that packets must arrive using.
scamper uses the IP address to identify the appropriate interface
to listen for packets.
.It Fl U Ar userid
specifies an unsigned integer to include with the data collected;
the meaning of the user-id is entirely up to the user and has no
effect on the behaviour of sniff.
.El
.Pp
The sole supported expression is icmp[icmpid] == X, where X is the
ICMP-ID to select.
.\""""""""""""
.Sh DATA COLLECTION FEATURES
.Nm
has two data output formats.
The first is a human-readable format suitable for one-off data collection and
measurement.
The second, known as
.Ic warts ,
is a binary format that records much more meta-data and is more precise than
the human-readable format.
.Pp
.Nm
is designed for Internet-scale measurement, where large lists of targets
are supplied for probing.
.Nm
has the ability to probe multiple lists simultaneously, with each having a
mix rate that specifies the priority of the list.
.Nm
can also make multiple cycles over a list of addresses.
.Pp
When writing output to a
.Ic warts
file,
.Nm
records details of the list and cycle that each measurement task belongs
to.
.\""""""""""""
.Sh CONTROL SOCKET
When started with the
.Fl P
option,
.Nm
allows inter-process communication via a TCP socket bound to the supplied
port on the local host.
This socket is useful for controlling the operation of a long-lived
.Nm
process.
A client may interact with scamper by using
.Xr telnet 1
to open a connection to the supplied port.
.Pp
The following control socket commands are available.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "   "
.It Ic exit
The exit command closes the current control socket connection.
.It Ic attach
The attach command changes how
.Nm
accepts and replies to commands, returning results straight over the control socket. See
.Sy ATTACH
section below for details on which commands are accepted.
.It Ic get Ar argument
The get command returns the current setting for the supplied argument.
Valid argument values are: holdtime, monitorname, pid, pps, sport, version.
.It Ic set Ar argument ...
The set command sets the current setting for the supplied argument.
Valid argument values are: holdtime, monitorname, pps.
.It Ic source Ar argument ...
.Bl -tag -width "   "
.It Ic add Ar arguments
The
.Ic source add
command allows a new input source to be added.
It accepts the following arguments:
.Bl -tag -width "   "
.It Ic name Ar string
The name of the source.  This parameter is mandatory.
.It Ic descr Ar string
An optional string describing the source.
.It Ic command Ar string
The command to execute for each address supplied.
If not supplied, the default command is used.
.It Ic list_id Ar uint32_t
An optional numeric list identifier, assigned by a human.
If not supplied, a value of zero is used.
.It Ic cycle_id Ar uint32_t
An optional numeric initial cycle identifier to use, assigned by a human.
If not supplied, a value of one is used.
.It Ic priority Ar uint32_t
An optional numeric value that specifies the mix rate of measurements from
the source compared to other sources.
If not supplied, a mix rate of one is used.
A value of zero causes the source to be created, but not actively used.
.It Ic outfile Ar string
The name of the output file to write results to, previously defined with
.Ic outfile open .
If not supplied, the default output file is used.
.It Ic file Ar string
The name of the input file to read target addresses from.
This parameter is mandatory if the source is a managed source.
.It Ic cycles Ar integer
The number of cycles to make over the target address file.
If zero,
.Nm
will loop indefinitely over the file.
This parameter is ignored unless a managed source is defined.
.It Ic autoreload Xo
.Op Cm on | off
.Xc
This parameter specifies if the target address file should be re-read whenever
a cycle is completed, or if the same set of target addresses as the previous
cycle should be used.
If not specified, the file is not automatically reloaded at cycle time.
.El
.It Ic update Ar name arguments
The
.Ic source update
command allows some properties of an existing source to be modified.
The source to update is specified with the
.Ar name
parameter.
Valid parameters are: autoreload, cycles, and priority.
.It Ic list Ar ...
The
.Ic source list
command provides a listing of all currently defined sources.
The optional third
.Ar name
parameter restricts the listing to the source specified.
.It Ic cycle Ar name
The
.Ic source cycle
command manually inserts a cycle marker in an adhoc source.
.It Ic delete Ar name
The
.Ic source delete
command deletes the named source, if possible.
.El
.It Ic outfile Ar argument ...
The outfile commands provide the ability to manage output files.
It accepts the following arguments:
.Bl -tag -width "   "
.It Ic open Ar ...
The
.Ic outfile open
command allows a new output file to be defined.
It accepts the following parameters:
.Bl -tag -width "   "
.It Ic name Ar alias
The alias of the output file.  This parameter is mandatory.
.It Ic file Ar string
The filename of the output file.  This parameter is mandatory.
.It Ic mode Xo
.Op Cm truncate | append
.Xc
How the file will be opened.
If the append mode is used, any existing file with the specified name will
be appended to.
If the truncate mode is used, any existing file will be truncated when it is
opened.
.El
.It Ic close Ar alias
The
.Ic outfile close
command allows an existing output file to be closed.
The mandatory
.Ar alias
parameter specifies which output file to close.
An output file that is currently referenced is not able to be closed.
To close a file that is currently referenced, a new outfile must be opened,
and then the
.Ic outfile swap
command be used.
.It Ic swap Ar alias1 alias2
The
.Ic outfile swap
command swaps the file associated with each output file.
.It Ic list
The
.Ic outfile list
command outputs a list of the existing outfiles.
.El
.It Ic observe sources
This command allows for monitoring of source events.
When executed, the control socket will then supply event notices
whenever a source is added, updated, deleted, finished, or cycled.
Each event is prefixed with a count of the number of seconds elapsed since
the Unix epoch.
The following examples illustrate the event monitoring capabilities:
.Pp
.Dl EVENT 1169065640 source add name 'foo' list_id 5 priority 1
.Dl EVENT 1169065641 source update 'foo' priority 15
.Dl EVENT 1169065642 source cycle 'bar' id 2
.Dl EVENT 1169065650 source finish 'bar'
.Dl EVENT 1169065661 source delete 'foo'
.It Ic shutdown Ar argument
The shutdown argument allows the
.Nm
process to be exited cleanly.  The following arguments are supported
.Bl -tag -width "   "
.It Ic done
The
.Ic shutdown done
command requests that
.Nm
shuts down when the current tasks, as well as all remaining cycles, have
completed.
.It Ic flush
The
.Ic shutdown flush
command requests that
.Nm
flushes all remaining tasks queued with each list, finishes all current
tasks, and then shuts down.
.It Ic now
The
.Ic shutdown now
command causes
.Nm
to shutdown immediately.
Unfinished tasks are purged.
.It Ic cancel
The
.Ic shutdown cancel
command cancels any pending shutdown.
.El
.El
.\""""""""""
.Sh ATTACH MODE
In attach mode, none of the usual interactive mode commands are usable.
Instead, commands may be entered directly and results will be sent back
directly over the control socket.
Commands are specified just as they would be with the -I flag for a
command-line invocation of
.Nm .
Replies are split into lines by single \\n characters and have one of the
following formats:
.Bl -tag -width "   "
.It Ic ERR Ar ...
A line starting with the 3 characters "ERR" indicates an error has occurred.
The rest of the line will contain an error message.
.It Ic OK Ar id-num
A line with the 2 characters "OK" indicates that scamper has accepted
the command.
.Nm
versions after 20110623 return an id number associated with the command,
which allow the task to be halted by subsequently issuing a "halt"
instruction.
.It Ic MORE
A line with just the 4 characters "MORE" indicates that scamper has the
capacity to accept more probing commands to run in parallel.
.It Ic DATA Ar length
A line starting with the 4 characters "DATA" follow by a space then a base-10
number indicates the start of result.
.Ar length
specifies the number of characters of the data, including newlines. The data
is in binary warts format and uuencoded before transmission.
.El
.Pp
To exit attached mode the client must send a single line containing "done".
To halt a command that has not yet completed, issue a "halt" instruction with
the id number returned when the command was accepted as the sole parameter.
.\""""""""""
.Sh EXAMPLES
To use the default traceroute command to trace the path to 192.0.2.1:
.Pp
.in +.5i
scamper -i 192.0.2.1
.in -.5i
.Pp
To infer Path MTU changes in the network and associate them with a traceroute
path:
.Pp
.in +.5i
scamper -I "trace -P udp-paris -M 192.0.2.1"
.in -.5i
.Pp
To use paris traceroute with ICMP probes, using 3 probes per hop, sending
all probes, writing to a specified warts file:
.Pp
.in +.5i
scamper -O warts -o file.warts -I "trace -P icmp-paris -q 3 -Q 192.0.2.1"
.in -.5i
.Pp
To ping a series of addresses defined in
.Ar filename ,
probing each address 10 times:
.Pp
.in +.5i
scamper -c "ping -c 10"
.Ar filename
.in -.5i
.Pp
Care must be taken with shell quoting when using commands with multiple levels
of quoting, such as when giving a probe description with a dealias command.
The following sends UDP probes to alternating IP addresses, one second apart,
and requires the IP-ID values returned to be strictly in sequence.
.Pp
.in +.5i
scamper -O warts -o ally.warts -I "dealias -O inseq -W 1000 -m ally -p '-P udp -i 192.0.2.1' -p '-P udp -i 192.0.2.4'"
.in -.5i
.Pp
Alternatively, the following accomplishes the same, but without specifying the
UDP probe method twice.
.Pp
.in +.5i
scamper -O warts -o ally.warts -I "dealias -O inseq -W 1000 -m ally -p '-P udp' 192.0.2.1 192.0.2.4"
.in -.5i
.Pp
The following command scans 198.51.100.0/28 for a matching alias to 192.0.2.4,
but skips 198.51.100.3.
.Pp
.in +.5i
scamper -O warts -o prefixscan.warts -I "dealias -O inseq -W 1000 -m prefixscan -p '-P udp' -x 198.51.100.3 192.0.2.4 198.51.100.0/28"
.in -.5i
.Pp
The following uses UDP probes to enumerate all per-flow load-balanced paths
towards 192.0.2.6 to 99% confidence; it varies the source port with each
probe.
.Pp
.in +.5i
scamper -I "tracelb -P udp-sport -c 99 192.0.2.6"
.in -.5i
