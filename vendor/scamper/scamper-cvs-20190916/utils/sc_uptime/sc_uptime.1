.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides the ability to connect to a running
.Xr scamper 1
instance and use it to collect data for inferring if and when a system with an
IPv6 address rebooted.
.Nm
induces each system to send fragmented ICMP echo replies, with the
goal of obtaining an incrementing Identifier (ID) field in the
fragmentation header.
If the system assigns ID values from a counter, and the counter resets
to zero, the system rebooted in the interval between probes.
Note, the technique does not work if the system does not send ICMP6
fragments, if fragments are blocked, or if the system assigns ID values
randomly.
.Nm
implements a scalable algorithm to avoid probing systems that assign
ID values at random or are unresponsive.
Further information about the algorithm is found in the "see also"
section.
The supported options to
.Nm
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
specifies the name of the input file which consists of a sequence of
IPv6 addresses to probe for reboots, one address per line.  Any new
addresses are added to the sqlite3 database for subsequent processing.
Any addresses in the sqlite3 database but not in the addressfile continue
to be probed.
.It Fl c
specifies that a sqlite3 database file is to be created.
The mode of database is specified with
.Fl O
.It Fl d Ar dbfile
specifies the name of the output sqlite3 database file to use
.It Fl E Ar expire
specifies the length of time, in days, that an address may remain in the probe
state database after last being seen in traceroute, and not responding
with incrementing IPID values.
.It Fl i
specifies that the IPID samples in the supplied
.Xr warts 5
files should be imported into the sqlite3 database.
.It Fl I Ar interval
specifies the desired probe interval, in seconds, for each address.
.It Fl l Ar logfile
specifies the name of a file to log progress output from
.Nm
generated at run time.
.It Fl o
specifies the name of the output file to be written.
The output file will use the
.Xr warts 5
format.
.It Fl O Ar options
allows the behavior of
.Nm
to be further tailored.
The current choices for this option are:
.Bl -dash -offset 2n -compact -width 1n
.It
.Sy init-state:
initialise a brand new sqlite3 database for data collection.
Use this option with
.Fl c
.It
.Sy init-data:
initialise a brand new sqlite3 database for data analysis.
Use this option with
.Fl c
.It
.Sy safe-db:
when importing into the data database, use safe operations.  By default,
.Nm
enables optimizations that will speed up bulk data importing, at the expense
of possible database corruption in the event power is lost during the import.
.It
.Sy vacuum-db:
perform a database vacuum before doing any operations.
.El
.It Fl p Ar port
specifies the port on the local host where
.Xr scamper 1
is accepting control socket connections.
.It Fl r
specifies that
.Nm
should use the IPID samples in the sqlite3 database to infer reboots.
.It Fl S Ar srcaddr
specifies the unicast IPv6 source address to use in probes.
This option is recommended when the prober has multiple or changing
IPv6 addresses, as some probed systems maintain an IPID counter
related to the source IPv6 address of the prober.
If the source address of probes changes, the returned IPID sequence
could have a discontinuity unrelated to a reboot of the probed system.
.It Fl U Ar unix-socket
specifies the name of a unix domain socket where
.Xr scamper 1
is accepting control socket connections.
.It Fl x
specifies that the do-not-probe list has been updated and the state
database should be cleared of matching addresses.  The do-not-probe
file is a text file with one prefix per line.  Individual addresses
may be specified by including the address without a suffix.

.Sh EXAMPLES
Given a set of IPv6 addresses contained in a file named
addrs.txt and a scamper process listening on port 31337
configured to probe at 30 packets per second started as follows:
.Pp
.Dl scamper -P 31337 -p 30
.Pp
the following command will create a sqlite3 database named
state.sqlite to record probe state within, probe the addresses
contained in addrs.txt once to collect raw data that can be used to
infer reboot windows, and store the raw data in out1.warts:
.Pp
.Dl sc_uptime -p 31337 -O create-db -d state.sqlite -a addrs.txt -o out1.warts
.Pp
To infer reboot windows,
.Nm
must be run in rounds.  The next time
.Nm
is run, use:
.Pp
.Dl sc_uptime -p 31337 -d state.sqlite -o out2.warts
.Pp
Import the IPID samples from out1.warts and out2.warts into a separate
probe database:
.Pp
.Dl sc_uptime -i -O create-db -d data.sqlite out1.warts out2.warts
.Pp
Infer reboots across all imported data:
.Pp
.Dl sc_uptime -r -d data.sqlite
.Pp
To infer reboots just for IPv6 address 2001:DB8::1, use:
.Pp
.Dl sc_uptime -r -d data.sqlite 2001:DB8::1
.Pp
.\""""""""""""
.Sh HINTS
Store the state.sqlite file on a memory file system to improve speed
and reduce disk wear.  In between invocations of
.Nm ,
copy the state.sqlite file to disk.
You can store probe data in the same database used to maintain state,
but you should use a separate database.
To obtain better performance, import the data into a time-series
database.
.Pp
.Sh NOTES
.Nm
will only probe addresses in 2000::/3.
